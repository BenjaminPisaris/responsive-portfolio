<h2>About Me</h2>
<p><img id="profile" src="https://i.imgur.com/e17NsHJ.jpg"> Hello! My name is Ben Pisaris. I’m a web development student from South Florida. I have 4 years of graphic design experience under my belt as a hobby. Most of my design work included branding work in Adobe Illustrator and 3d modeling in Cinema4d. I have long since stepped away from that brand, and am attending web development bootcamp to learn some new tricks and attain a hirable portfolio.
<br>
       <br> I’m an avid gamer. My favorite series is Kingdom Hearts. I also played many first person shooter games as well, including Modern Warfare 2, the Halo series, and some Call of Duty: World War 2 and Counter Strike: Global Offensive at a competitive level.
        <br>
        <br>My long term goals are to master full-stack web design, expand my personal brand (<a href="http://boolin.co">Boolin Co.</a>), and break into the social media management industry.
